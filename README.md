AutoRetina
==========

The AutoRetina Tool is an Unity3D Script, that is useful for iOS Developers who want to support all of the newer iOS Devices. With AutoRetina Unity Developers can define which iOS Devices should run at retina resolution and which should not. The selection of these devices is made automatically by the Toolkit based on the Device Model, the GPU/CPU or the amount of graphics memory of the device. The developer just has to give the toolkit information about the devices, on which devices the app should run at retina resolution, or how many graphics memory the device should have to run the game at retina resolution, once this information is passed to the script it automatically changes the resolution of the devices to the right one.


How to use:
To use AutoRetina you just have to copy the AutoRetina Toolkit folder into your Project. Once you did that you can use all commands of the AutoRetina class. For more information check out the wiki.
